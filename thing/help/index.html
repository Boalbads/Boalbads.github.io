Why is Roblox not opening when I press open?
	
</h2>

<br>

<p>
Roblox will ONLY open if it has been correctly installed to: "C:/Program Files/06blox". (A correct installation looks like <a href=https://boalbads.github.io/thing/help/correctinstall.bmp>this. </a>) If all the files are correctly installed, and you are using Internet Explorer, Roblox should open. If it still doesn't work, you will have to open roblox manually.
