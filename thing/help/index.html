What do I do with the join script?

The join script is used to join the server, to use it, Open roblox, go to 'Tools', 'Execute Script', navigate to where the join script is, and double click on it.

Why is Roblox not opening when I press open?
	
</h>

<br>

<p>
Roblox will ONLY open if it has been correctly installed to: "C:/Program Files/06blox". (A correct installation looks like <a href=https://boalbads.github.io/thing/help/correctinstall.xxx>this. </a>) If all the files are correctly installed, Roblox should open. Please contact an engineer if it doesn't work.
